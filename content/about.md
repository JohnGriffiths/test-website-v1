### TEAM

Embrained, LLC was founded in 2026 by Dr. Christopher Harris, a neuroscientist, creator of the SpikerBot, and former Principal Investigator at Backyard Brains. We are a neurorobotics company dedicated to democratizing access to embodied AI for enthusiasts, students, researchers, and developers.

See the [Team](#Team) page for more info on current Embrained members. 



### APPROACH: Disaggregated Embodied Intelligence

We reject the industry trend of cramming expensive, compromised computers onto battery-powered toys. Instead, we decouple the robot's "brain" from its "body." By wirelessly tethering the robot to the user’s powerful gaming PC or workstation, we unlock professional-grade artificial intelligence — such as Vision-Language-Action models — that standalone devices simply cannot handle.

We extend this modular philosophy to the hardware itself, separating the sensory "head" and reflexive "spinal cord" from the mechanical chassis. This allows us to focus on our core strengths in AI, signal processing, and control, while mandating reliable, high-torque third-party platforms — like the Wave Rover — to ensure robust navigation performance.


### MARKET[S]

We serve the "Prosumer & Research" market — university students, engineers, and tech enthusiasts who have outgrown under-powered smart toys and require state-of-the-art embodied agents. By integrating third-party rover chassis directly into our official build instructions, we ensure that every Embrained agent is built on a foundation of quality, high-performance hardware.

We are building a future of privacy-native home robotics where we want your math, not your video. By pooling our data, training together, and sharing our models, we will unlock a new era of personal robots that understand your local environment and know how to act in it to support your goals.


### PRIVACY & COMPLIANCE

<strong>We want your math, *not* your video.</strong><br>
Our architecture is privacy-native. We utilize cryptographic visual hashing to process spatial data, ensuring raw imagery is ephemeral. Furthermore, all Embrained mobile agents are designed to comply with the <em>Stop Electronic Stalking Act of 2025</em>, featuring hardware-level "Tally Lights" to indicate active inference.
